            <summary>How does the toy swap/giveaway work? </summary>
            <p>Our app allows you to list toys your children have outgrown or no longer play with. You can choose to either offer them for a direct swap with another user's listed toy or give them away for free. Browse listings from other users in your area, and if you find something you like, you can propose a swap or express interest in a giveaway.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do I list a toy? What information do I need to provide?</summary>
            <p>To list a toy, tap the "List a Toy" button. You'll need to provide a clear photo of the toy, a detailed description including its condition, age range suitability (if known), and whether you're open to swaps, giveaways, or both. You can also specify categories and keywords to help others find your listing.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do I propose a swap or request a giveaway? What happens next?</summary>
            <p>If you find a toy you'd like to swap for, tap the "Exchange" button on the listing. You'll be able to select one of your listed toys to offer in exchange. To request giveaways, simply tap the "Request" button and optionally include a message explaining why you're interested. The other user will then review your proposal or request and can accept, decline, or counter-offer (for swaps). You'll receive a notification of their decision.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do we arrange the actual swap or pickup of a given-away toy?</summary>
            <p>Once a swap or giveaway is agreed upon, you and the other user can communicate directly through the app's messaging feature to coordinate the exchange. This includes deciding on a mutually convenient time and safe public location for the exchange.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I edit or delete my toy listings?</summary>
            <p>Yes, you can easily edit or delete your listings. Navigate to your "Profile" or "My Listings" section. From there, you'll find options to modify the details of your listed toys (photos, descriptions, swap/giveaway preferences) or to remove a listing entirely if the toy is no longer available.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Is there a limit to how many toys I can list?</summary>
            <p>Currently, there is no strict limit on the number of toys you can list. We encourage you to share as many suitable toys as you have! However, we reserve the right to review accounts with an unusually high number of listings to ensure fair usage and the quality of our platform.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How is safety ensured on the app? What are the community guidelines?</summary>
            <p>We encourage users to prioritize safety during exchanges. We recommend meeting in well-lit public places. Please do not share personal information like your home address directly in public listings. Our community guidelines emphasize respectful communication, accurate toy descriptions, and fair dealing. Users can report inappropriate behavior or suspicious listings to our moderation team, who will review and take necessary action. We also advise users to thoroughly inspect toys before completing a swap or accepting a giveaway.</p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What if I have a problem with a swap or giveaway? Is there support available?</summary>
            <p>If you encounter any issues with a swap or giveaway (e.g., a user is unresponsive, the toy is not as described), please use the "Report User" or "Contact Support" feature within the app. Provide as much detail as possible about the problem, and our support team will investigate and try to assist in resolving the situation according to our community guidelines.</p>
